## Project Overview
This booking website simplifies the process of scheduling meetings and appointments. Key features include:
- Users can create recurring or one-time booking pages and share links for others to reserve time slots.
- Non-registered users can reserve time slots without needing an account, while registered users can create and manage bookings.
- Meeting organizers can specify if slots accept single or multiple participants.
- Booking confirmations are sent via email using PHPMailer.
- Users can send alternative time requests if the listed availabilities donâ€™t suit them.
- We have implemented all required features outlined in the project description, including use cases like recurring office hours, one-time events, and alternative time suggestions.
